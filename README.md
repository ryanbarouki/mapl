## How to play
Welcome to the Mapl - the redacted map game! Your challenge is to identify the location marked on the redacted map. 

You'll have three attempts to pinpoint the marker's exact location. With each incorrect guess, the map zooms out, making the task slightly easier.
Keep in mind that precision matters! If you can guess within 50km of the actual location at any point, you'll earn an automatic score!

Strive for the highest score possible â€“ a maximum of 10,000 points is up for grabs. Aim to get as close to the mark as you can, using as few guesses as possible.
