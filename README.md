# TODO
- Add a play again button at the end
- Add error handling for API and timeout
- Add a breakdown at the end
- Multiple rounds?
- Maybe generate coords and pick one randomly -- avoids API call
- Fix map resizing issues when changing screen size
- consider removing road signs or add them on the second go
