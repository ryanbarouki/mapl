# TODO
- Add a play again button at the end
- Add a breakdown at the end
- Multiple rounds?
- Sort the globe map out -- should be mercator proj.
- Stop user being able to guess before coords loaded -- better loading screen
- Maybe generate coords and pick one randomly -- avoids API call
- Add details of final answer on the end screen e.g. Paris, France
- Fix map resizing issues when changing screen size
