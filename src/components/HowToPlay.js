      <Title>How to play Mapl!</Title>
      <P>Welcome to the <strong>Mapl</strong> - the redacted map game!
        Your challenge is to identify the location marked on the redacted map.
        You'll have <strong>three attempts</strong> to pinpoint the marker's exact location.
        With each incorrect guess, <strong>the map zooms out</strong>, making the task slightly easier.
      </P>
      <P>
        Keep in mind that precision matters!
        If you can guess <strong>within 50km</strong> of the actual location at any point,
        you'll earn an automatic score!
      </P>
      <P>
        Strive for the highest score possible â€“ a <strong>maximum of 10,000 points</strong>  is up for grabs.
        Aim to get as close to the mark as you can, using as few guesses as possible.
      </P>
    </Modal>
